**Food Delivery Time Prediction Model**

Predicting food delivery time helps improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by providing accurate delivery time estimates. This allows food delivery services to better manage resources, optimize routes, and set realistic delivery expectations, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.
This project predicts food delivery time using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model calculates distances between the restaurant and the delivery location, converting latitude and longitude from degrees to radians for accuracy.

**Project Overview**

*Objective:* Accurately predict delivery time based on historical data, enhancing operational efficiency for food delivery services.

*Key Features:*
~Distance calculation using Haversine formula (converts degrees to radians).
~Time-series prediction using LSTM, ideal for handling sequential delivery data.

*Requirements:*
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, tensorflow (for LSTM), math (for distance calculation)

*Dataset:*
The dataset includes attributes like delivery ID, delivery person's age, ratings, restaurant and delivery location coordinates, order type, vehicle type, and time taken (in minutes).

*Results:*
Expected outputs include predicted delivery times, which can be compared to actual times for model evaluation

**Conclusion**

The Food Delivery Time Prediction model demonstrates the potential of LSTM networks in accurately forecasting delivery times, which is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing logistics in food delivery services. By incorporating geospatial distance calculations, the model provides a realistic approximation of travel time, accounting for the unique constraints of each delivery route. Future enhancements could include additional variables like traffic conditions and weather to improve accuracy further. This model serves as a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making in the food delivery industry.
